____
## Outline
* Create front end for 2-4 players (depending on complexity)
* Create land tiles to be placed (via DnD)
* Create sheep tiles to be placed (via DND)
* Add DnD to land and sheep tiles
* Create drop zones on "playing area" for land placement
* Once all tiles are placed add DnD to the land tiles that were just placed
___

## Rules/Notes to remember
* Layout will start as columns on the side to hold the land pieces that will be placed before game begins
* Land pieces need to be able to be rotated (potentially add a button on the side to rotate 90deg?)
* After the last piece is placed (16),the side columns will split into 4 rectangles to hold each player's sheep
* The land pieces will then become drop zones (or it may be possible to leave the existing drop zones and reuse them?)
* Each player takes turns placing their entire stack of sheep onto an edge of the playing board.
* Once each player has done that, they take turns picking a tile in a straight line from their starting point and moving any number of the sheep from that starting point as far down the line as possible.
* Sheep MUST travel in a straight line and they MUST travel the entire length of the line.
* Sheep cannot jump other sheep, cannot stop halfway down the decided line, and cannot drop sheep tokens behind as they travel.
